ðŸŒ¦ Weather App â€“ Project Summary
This is a simple desktop weather application built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It allows users to select an Indian state or union territory from a dropdown menu and retrieve real-time weather data such as:

ðŸŒ¤ Weather Condition (e.g., Clear, Rainy)
ðŸŒ« Climate Description (e.g., light rain, overcast clouds)
ðŸŒ¡ Temperature in Celsius
ðŸŒ¬ Atmospheric Pressure

The app fetches this data from an online weather API using the requests module and displays the results in a clean and user-friendly GUI. It's a great project demonstrating how to work with APIs, handle GUI layouts, and build responsive apps in Python.
